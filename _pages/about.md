I am a PhD student in the [Department of Information Science and Technology](http://www.it.fudan.edu.cn/En) at the [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en) under the supervision of [Prof. Tao Chen](https://eetchen.github.io/).

My main research interest is in devising deep learning methods for various 3D vision analysis and synthesis tasks.
